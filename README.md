## About This Repository

This repository contains my completed Python assignments from the AI Developer course I’m currently enrolled in. These assignments cover everything from beginner-level syntax to more complex topics like fuzzy logic, scraping, and algorithms. Each folder represents a themed module in the course, and each script was written with clarity, growth, and originality in mind.

I’ve intentionally structured this repo not just to meet requirements but to reflect how I think and learn. Each assignment has been carefully written, tested, and pushed using GitHub Desktop or the terminal, depending on the context.

## Folder Structure

- `aco_python_assignment`: Ant colony optimization challenge
- `algo_data_struct_assignments`: Algorithm and data structure exercises (e.g., bubble sort)
- `basic_ai_algorithms`: Foundational AI logic implementation
- `fuzzy_py_assignments`: Fuzzy logic generation and classification
- `pandas_assignments`: Tabular data manipulation and exploration
- `scraping_assignments`: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and requests
- `simple_python_assignments`: Foundational syntax and flow control

---

## Approach

- **Every challenge is original.**
- **I don't reuse generic code — all solutions are uniquely written and aligned to my learning journey.**
- **Where applicable, I add personal twists, symbolic elements, or advanced logic.**

---

## Running the Code

You can clone this repo and run any `.py` file independently. No external dependencies are required for most of these, unless stated in the script via `import` statements. A few assignments may require libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, or `bs4`.

## Current Focus

I’m currently working through the **Algorithms and Data Structures** module. I'm building core fundamentals in both Python and R to reinforce key concepts through repetition and practice across languages.
